# My Vue App

This is a basic Vue.js application setup using Vite for development and build processes.

### Install npm packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Start a development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start Vite in development mode.

### Testing

To run tests using Jest:

```bash
npm test
```

### Build

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will run TypeScript compiler (vue-tsc) first and then build the app using Vite.
